title: Top 10 React.js Errors and Their Simple Fixes Every Developer Should Know
---

# 👋 Introduction

Hey there! I’m a frontend developer who has spent countless hours fixing small but frustrating React bugs 😅. If you’ve worked with React, chances are you’ve run into some of these errors too.

Instead of textbook explanations, here are real-world React errors I personally faced, along with simple fixes that can save you hours of debugging. Let’s dive in! 💻👇

## 🚨 1. “React is not defined” Error

Error Message:

```javascript
'React' must be in scope when using JSX react / react -in -jsx - scope
```

Why It Happens: JSX requires React in scope in older versions (pre-React 17).

✅ Solution:

```javascript
import React from "react";
```

Note: From React 17+, importing React is optional, but linting tools may still require it.

## 🧱 2. “Cannot read property ‘map’ of undefined”

Error Message:

```javascript
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined(reading 'map')
```

Why It Happens: Trying to map over data before it’s loaded.

✅ Solution:

```javascript
{ myArray?.map(item => <div>{item.name}</div>) }
```

💡 Always initialize arrays with useState(\[]) to avoid this.

## 💣 3. “Each child in a list should have a unique ‘key’ prop”

Why It Happens: Rendering lists without a unique key prop.

✅ Solution:

```javascript
{
  users.map(user => (
    <UserCard key={user.id} data={user} />
  ))
}
```

❗ Avoid using index as a key unless necessary.

## 🧠 4. “Hooks can only be called inside of a function component”

Why It Happens: Using hooks incorrectly (outside components, inside loops, or conditions).

✅ Solution:

```javascript
function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
}
```

Always follow the Rules of Hooks.

## 📦 5. “Module not found: Can’t resolve”

Why It Happens: Typos in file paths or missing extensions.

✅ Solution:

* Double-check paths and extensions.
* Use absolute imports with jsconfig.json or tsconfig.json.

## 🔁 6. Component keeps re-rendering infinitely

Why It Happens: State updates inside useEffect dependencies.

✅ Solution:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  // logic without causing state loop
}, []);
```

## 🔐 7. “Cannot destructure property … of ‘undefined’”

Why It Happens: Destructuring props or objects before they exist.

✅ Solution:

```javascript
function Profile({ user = {} }) {
  const { name } = user;
}
```

## ⚠️ 8. “Too many re-renders”

Why It Happens: Updating state directly in the component body.

❌ Bad:

```javascript
setCount(count + 1);
```

✅ Good (use useEffect):

```javascript
useEffect(() => setCount(c => c + 1), []);
```

## 🧪 9. “Cannot update a component while rendering a different component”

Why It Happens: Updating parent state during child render.

✅ Solution: Use callbacks triggered from events, not during render.

## 🧰 10. “Uncontrolled input becoming controlled”

Why It Happens: Mixing value with defaultValue.

✅ Solution:

```javascript
<input value={name || ""} onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)} />
```
