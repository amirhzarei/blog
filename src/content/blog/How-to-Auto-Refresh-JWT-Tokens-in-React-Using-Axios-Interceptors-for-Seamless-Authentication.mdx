title: How to Auto-Refresh JWT Tokens in React Using Axios Interceptors
---

# 🔑 Introduction

Authentication is at the core of modern React apps, and JWT (JSON Web Tokens) has become the go-to solution. The challenge? JWTs usually have a short lifespan for security reasons. Once expired, users are often forced to log in again.

That’s where auto-refresh with Axios interceptors comes in. Instead of logging out users when their token expires, we can silently request a new token and retry the failed request — keeping the experience smooth and secure.

## 🚦 Why Token Auto-Refresh Matters

* Access Tokens: Short-lived, used for each request.
* Refresh Tokens: Long-lived, used only to request new access tokens.

Without refresh logic:

* With refresh logic:
* Expired token → interceptor fetches new one → retry request → user stays logged in.

## ⚙️ Step 1: Create an Axios Instance

```javascript
// src/utils/axios.ts
import axios from "axios";

export const axiosInstance = axios.create({
  baseURL: import.meta.env.VITE_BACKEND_API_URL,
  withCredentials: true, // required for secure cookies
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
});
```

## ⚙️ Step 2: Add a Refresh Function

```javascript
const refreshToken = async () => {
  return axios.post(
    `${import.meta.env.VITE_BACKEND_API_URL}/auth/refresh`,
    {},
    { withCredentials: true }
  );
};
```

## ⚙️ Step 3: Configure the Response Interceptor

```javascript
import { useAuthStore } from "../store";

axiosInstance.interceptors.response.use(
  (response) => response,
  async (error) => {
    const originalRequest = error.config;

    if (error.response?.status === 401 && !originalRequest._isRetry) {
      originalRequest._isRetry = true;
      try {
        await refreshToken(); // request new access token
        return axiosInstance(originalRequest); // retry original request
      } catch (err) {
        useAuthStore.getState().logout();
        return Promise.reject(err);
      }
    }
    return Promise.reject(error);
  }
);
```

## 📂 Step 4: State Management with Zustand

Zustand keeps track of authentication state:

* Stores user data and tokens.
* Clears everything when logout is triggered.

This makes handling token expiration and retries much easier.

## 🎯 Real-World Example

Imagine you’re building an Admin Dashboard:

1. User logs in → gets access token (15 min) + refresh token (7 days).
2. Token expires while browsing.
3. Interceptor catches 401 Unauthorized.
4. Refresh API provides a new token.
5. 👉 The user never even notices.

## 🏁 Conclusion

By setting up Axios interceptors with refresh tokens, your React apps will handle expired JWTs gracefully. This means:

* A smoother user experience.
* Better security practices.
* Cleaner code with centralized authentication logic.
