title: 10 Common Next.js Mistakes Beginners Make and How to Avoid Them
---

# Introduction

Next.js is a powerful React framework—but that power comes with a learning curve. As someone who’ve stumbled through many of these mistakes, I’m laying them out here so you can avoid hours of debugging and frustration.

## Mistake 1: Mixing SSR, SSG, ISR, and CSR

The problem: Treating every page the same way—often using getServerSideProps even when unnecessary.

The fix:

* Use SSG (getStaticProps) for static content (blogs, documentation).
* SSR (getServerSideProps) only when fresh data is crucial.
* ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) when you want mostly static pages that still update.

## Mistake 2: Ignoring File-Based Routing

The problem: Trying to use React Router instead of harnessing Next.js’s built-in routing.

The fix: Simply use the pages/ directory (or app/) to define routes via files—Next.js handles the rest with nested folders for structure.

## Mistake 3: Not Using next/image Properly

The problem: Falling back on classic \<img> tags.

The fix: Embrace the Image component from next/image—it automatically handles resizing, lazy loading, and format conversion (like to WebP). Don’t forget to configure next.config.js for external image domains.

## Mistake 4: Forgetting Head for SEO

The problem: Overlooking basic SEO essentials.

The fix: Use \<Head> from next/head to define page titles, meta descriptions, and Open Graph tags—crucial for search engines and social media previews.

## Mistake 5: Misusing API Routes

The problem: Building a full backend in Next.js API routes.

The fix: Reserve API routes for simple use cases—like forms or webhooks. For full backend logic, rely on external services such as Node.js, Firebase, or Supabase.

## Mistake 6: Mishandling Static Assets

The problem: Importing images or assets like in a standard React app.

The fix: Place assets in the /public folder and reference them directly (e.g., \<img src="/logo.png" />). No import needed.

## Mistake 7: Poor Redirects & Middleware Usage

The problem: Handling redirects client-side or ignoring the built-in mechanisms.

The fix: Use next.config.js for server-side redirects or employ middleware for conditional logic like auth or geolocation flows.

## Mistake 8: Skipping Build Optimizations

The problem: Bloated deployment builds and slow performance.

The fix:

* Remove unused dependencies.
* Enable image and font optimizations.
* Use dynamic imports (next/dynamic) for large components.

## Mistake 9: Skipping Error Handling

The problem: Assuming everything will work as expected—no fallbacks for failed requests or missing data.

The fix:

* Use try/catch around async fetches.

## Mistake 10: Falling Behind on Updates

The problem: Using outdated patterns or ignoring new Next.js features.

The fix: Stay current. Follow Next.js release notes, subscribe to newsletters, watch Vercel videos—and start using features like the App directory or server components as they become stable.

## Closing Thoughts

These ten mistakes are common—and often frustrating—but they’re all fixable once you’re aware of them. Learn the conventions, leverage optimizations, and invest a little extra into error handling and architecture—and your Next.js apps will be cleaner, faster, and easier to scale.
