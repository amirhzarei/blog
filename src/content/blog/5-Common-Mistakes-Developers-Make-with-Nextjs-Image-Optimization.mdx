title: 5 Common Mistakes Developers Make with Next.js Image Optimization
---

# 🚀 Why Image Optimization Matters in Next.js

Images are often the largest assets on a web page. If they’re not optimized properly, they can:

* Drag down Lighthouse scores
* Worsen Core Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID)
* Hurt SEO rankings
* Cause higher bounce rates

The built-in \<Image> component in Next.js 15 is powerful, but only if you use it correctly. Let’s break down the top 5 mistakes developers make and how to avoid them.

## ❌ 1. Using \<img> Instead of \<Image>

The issue: Using raw HTML \<img> tags bypasses Next.js optimizations like lazy loading, resizing, and WebP conversion.

Fix: Always use the next/image component.

```javascript
import Image from "next/image";

<Image
  src="/images/hero.jpg"
  alt="Hero"
  width={1200}
  height={800}
/>
```

✅ Benefits: automatic responsive sizing, lazy loading, and format optimization.

## ❌ 2. Skipping Width & Height

The issue: Not specifying dimensions causes layout shifts, hurting CLS scores.

Fix: Provide explicit width and height or use fill inside a styled parent container.

```javascript
<Image
  src="/images/blog-thumbnail.png"
  alt="Blog Thumbnail"
  width={400}
  height={300}
/>
```

🧠 Pro tip: Wrap with a relative container and use fill when dimensions are fluid.

## ❌ 3. Forgetting Placeholders

The issue: White flashes or blank spaces while loading images.

Fix: Add a blur-up placeholder with placeholder="blur".

```javascript
<Image
  src="/images/banner.jpg"
  alt="Banner"
  width={1200}
  height={600}
  placeholder="blur"
  blurDataURL="/images/banner-blur.jpg"
/>
```

✨ Smooth loading, improved perceived performance.

## ❌ 4. Misconfigured next.config.js

The issue: External images break or don’t optimize properly.

Fix: Add allowed domains and formats:

```javascript
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  images: {
    domains: ["cdn.example.com"],
    formats: ["image/webp"],
  },
};
```

⚠️ Without domains, Next.js will block external images.

## ❌ 5. Not Testing with Lighthouse

The issue: Assuming optimizations work without measuring.

Fix: Run Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools and compare before/after.

📊 Example:

* LCP improved from 4.2s → 2.1s
* CLS dropped from 0.23 → 0.03
* Performance score: 61 → 91

## 💥 Bonus: Responsive Images

Don’t forget to serve different sizes for mobile and desktop.

```javascript
<Image
  src="/images/mobile-friendly.jpg"
  alt="Responsive Example"
  width={1200}
  height={800}
  sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 50vw"
  style={{ width: "100%", height: "auto" }}
/>
```

🎯 Result: mobile users load lighter images, saving bandwidth and improving speed.

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

Next.js image optimization is more than just swapping \<img> for \<Image>. It’s about proper usage: set dimensions, use placeholders, configure domains, and always test with Lighthouse.

A quick audit today can dramatically improve performance, SEO, and user experience.
